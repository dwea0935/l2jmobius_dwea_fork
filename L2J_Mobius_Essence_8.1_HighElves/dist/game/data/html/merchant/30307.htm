Obviously, Elves are experts in blacksmithing, although they focus on mithril. No doubt it's perfect material... strong, light and good for magic enhancements.<br>
But I look beyond this tradition and research other metals too. I know how to work on adamantite and damascus, also not long ago I've learned how to work on oriharukon.<br>
