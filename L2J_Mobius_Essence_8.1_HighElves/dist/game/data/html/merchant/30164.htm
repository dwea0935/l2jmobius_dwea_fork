Welcome to the very heart of magic - to the Ivory Tower!<br>
Nowadays people think about the Ivory Tower as about some kind of a research center in the first place. But once it was a powerful political fraction and had the whole continent under its control. How do you think, where all the knowledge is storaged? Right here, in the Tower!<br>
When we have to face a global crisis, here in the Ivory Tower we can always find the solution and maybe even find out what was the reason.<br>
