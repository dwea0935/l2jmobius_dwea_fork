Hm, lately there have been rumors about a partial opening of the border with Elmore, but it's not clear whether it's misheard talks from bigwigs and they're going to tighten the screws even more instead...<br>
You see, my brother moved to Elmore hoping to start a trading business there... And I'm worried that I won't be able to see him ever again.<br>
By the way, as you can learn any skill with a Magic Tablet, I don't exchange Spellbooks now.
