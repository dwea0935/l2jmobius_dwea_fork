<html><body>Merchant Kunai:<br>
On to immortal glory of the flame flower! You are a true warrior of our tribe! Welcome!<br>
I'm Kunai, an armor merchant! I bring my goods from Dwarves. I guarantee high quality of our work. Dwarves deserve a good threshing for sure, but they are crafting fine items. If we don't trade their goods, Elves and Humans will do so. Damn, we have to suffer privations for eternal glory of our tribe! Well, take a look.<br>
