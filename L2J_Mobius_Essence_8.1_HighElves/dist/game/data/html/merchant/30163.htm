Welcome to the Ivory Tower!<br>
This place is known as the refuge for sorcerers, but not only mages live here. Everyone is welcome. I myself was once a Paladin in the service of Einhasad. But I did not betray my oath!<br>
As you know, strange things often happen in this tower. Don't go where you should not, even if you are very curious. It may be dangerous.<br>
