<html><body>Blacksmith Aios:<br>
Let the mithril light shine over lakes and forests eternally! I'm a blacksmith helping our Elven brothers to watch over weapons. Not long ago I've been traveling all over the Dwarven Kingdom and learned how to work on adamantite and oriharukon.<br>
I was preparing a great while and recently started to work to the full extent. So, what do you need?<br>
