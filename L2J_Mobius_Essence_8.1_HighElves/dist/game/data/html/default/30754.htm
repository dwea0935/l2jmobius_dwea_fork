<html><body>Antharas Watchman Gilmore:<br>
My name is Gilmore, I am the Antharas' Watchman.<br>
Antharas is one of the six dreadful ancient dragons created by Shilien. Now he is in deep sleep, and I watch him in order to warn everybody of Antharas' awakening when that happens.<br>
In order to better perform my duties I decided to stop teleporting adventurers to the Center of Dragon Valley.<br>
You can now use a Teleport to move to the Center of Dragon Valley all by yourself. But keep in mind that it's a very dangerous place. Please be careful.
