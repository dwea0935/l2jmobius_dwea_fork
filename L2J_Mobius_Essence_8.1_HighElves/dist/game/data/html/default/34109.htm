<html><body>Elder Ragnir:<br>
Although Kamaels were the Giants' creations, we didn't want to live under the domination of our creators, and therefore had to flee.<br>
For the long time we have been living in seclusion, apart from the common world. So long, that the world itself has changed. And finally our people can live freely.<br>
We have awakened from the long sleep having lost most of our painful memories of the past. We are entering the new life leaving those memories behind.
