<html><body>Adventure Guildsman Maron:<br>
Hello! My name is Maron, I'm from the Adventure Guild.<br>
Usually, <font color="LEVEL">Anghel Waterfall</font> is a rather quiet place. But recently, the adventurers began to find strange artifacts here, and later monsters appeared.<br>
Where all this came from and why, no one knows. The king of Aden ordered our guild to look into what happened.<br>
We've just started the case, so we haven't found anything useful yet.<br>
Such artifacts are said to have been found in other places as well - <font color="LEVEL">at the Ancient Battleground, the Enchanted Valley, the Ivory Tower Crater and the Blazing Swamp</font>. I hope you can help us explore them.
