Stay pround of your own race.<br>
I am Dark Elf Hierarch Vellior - I have learned the truth of darkness from the pages of the revered Book of Icarus! I am the highest ranking wizard to control the black magic of the Dark Elves.<br>
The origin of our power is intertwined with the powers of darkness, the very <font color="LEVEL">Black Magic</font> that is forbidden to the races. They are afraid. Afraid of the dark. Afraid of the shadows and what lurks within. They cling to the light, silly fools! Don't they realize that wherever there is light, there is shadow? I bet you do. You face the darkness without fear. I sense that you too can learn to control the powers of black magic.<br>
