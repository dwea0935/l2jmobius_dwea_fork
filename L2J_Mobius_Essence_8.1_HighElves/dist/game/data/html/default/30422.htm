<html><body>Abyssal Celebrant Kalinta:<br>
Greetings in the name of Shillien! There are those who think that Shillien brings misfortune, as she is the goddess of death. Others regard her as a demon, and her followers as heathens.<br>
However, all living creatures will eventually perish. No matter how strong their dread of Shillien is or how hard they try to avoid and forget her, their lives will come to an end and they all will find peace in Shillien's embrace. All are equal in the halls of Shillien that are called death.
