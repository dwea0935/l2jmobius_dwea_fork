From ancient times people of Elmore have been showing reverence to the art of war and have been studying it... The Temple of Einhasad in Goddard offered a part of its building to the Warrior Guild and supported the guild!<br>
Of course, it does not mean we endorse violence! But history taught us that we have to have strong army to protect peace and harmony.
