It's good that you've come.<br>
Warriors like you must always train a lot and be ready to sacrifice everything for Orcs at any time.<br>
Getting skills requires experience. I cannot simply explain to you how to become a great warrior. You must try everything that I teach you for yourself.<br>
Heed my teachings, and my skills will surely become your skills. Are you ready to begin?
