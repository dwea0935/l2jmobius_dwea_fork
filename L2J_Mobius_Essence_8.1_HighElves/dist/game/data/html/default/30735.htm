<html><body>Mercenary Captain Sophya:<br>
Ah, it is always such a pleasure to see a fresh-faced traverler! My name is Sophya. I command the 4th platoon of the Black Lion Mercenary Troop. We have been hired by the mayor of Dion to drive away evil spirits. I fear that I underestimated the number of evil spirits in this place when I took this job.<br>
If you plan to travel in the vicinity of Gludio or Giran, you should prepare yourself for attack from an Enku Orc or a dire wolf. You look skillful enough, I expect that you will survive.<br>
