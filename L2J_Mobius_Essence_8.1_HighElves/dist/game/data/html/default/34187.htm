Balance and harmony are the most important things in life.<br>
My name is Berkh. I'm guarding the pass from the Ivory Tower to Hellbound.<br>
We are looking for brave heroes who can stop Beleth planning to conquer all the continent.<br>
You can teleport to Hellbound from the Ivory Tower <font color="LEVEL">on Saturdays from 10:00 till 24:00</font>.<br>
But keep in mind that only characters of <font color="LEVEL">Lv. 85 or higher</font> can be transferred to Hellbound.
