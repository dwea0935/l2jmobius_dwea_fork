<html><body>Priestess Shegfield:<br>
Welcome to the sacred Temple of Einhasad. You know, I was born here. Really! In fact, I actually grew up playing with Priest Glyvka. Hahaha! Believe it or not, when I was little we throught this place was haunted! So many strange noises, strange lights... But then, when we finally devoted ourselves to Einhasad, we found the peace in the ephemeral noise and lights of this place.
