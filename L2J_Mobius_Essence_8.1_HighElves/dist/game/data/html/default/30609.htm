<html><body>Astrologer Creta:<br>
Welcome, stranger... My name is Creta and I earn my living by fortune telling. Once people thought I was a witch and tried to burn me alive, that is why I decided to live far from any villages.<br>
My advice is sought even by the most noble of lords, but... Einhasad's priests hate me with a fierce loathing, as they believe that only Gods can see our future.<br>
