It was <font color="LEVEL">Death Lord Hallate</font>, the leader of the army of darkness. Also known as Arrogant Invader, or the Nemesis of Angels... anyway. He offered me an opportunity to create a masterpiece that would go down in history. My wife tried to dissuade me, but I wouldn't listen... and I made a deal with a devil.<br>
And it was REiria, my beloved wife, who paid the price for my sin...!<br>
What's the use? It's over and done with! I can't... I can't bear to think about it...<br>
Leave me...!
