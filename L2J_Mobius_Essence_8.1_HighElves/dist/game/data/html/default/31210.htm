<html><body>Race Track Gatekeeper:<br>
Welcome to the Monster Race Track!<br>
As you can see, the race track owner took the plunge and contracted with the Ivory Tower, so now you can come here from any big city through the Gatekeeper! Also, to protect the custormer's funds, we blocked the path to the outside and strengthened censorship.<br>
So, now go inside and enjoy our Monster Race Track! You deserve a holiday!<br>
