The Ivory Tower was nearly destroyed when the Elmoreden Empire fell. It survived not because of its power - although t he Ivory Tower had enough to control the continent - but because its focus changed to become a pure research and educational institution.<br>
Some other magisters argue that we should take up our old causes again, but personally I think we are better off this way.<br>
