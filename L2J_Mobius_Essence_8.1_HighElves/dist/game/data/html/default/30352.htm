As you know, four Hierarch rule the Dark Elves. In the name of our Hierarch, who was sealed away by the Humans, they have triumphantly led our race for the past 400 years. At times they have competed over power, but in times of crisis, all followed the will of Hierarch Thifiell.<br>
The Hierarchs assign young Dark Elves various tasks to train them. If you are interested, I suggest you meet one. I am curious what trial you will receive.
