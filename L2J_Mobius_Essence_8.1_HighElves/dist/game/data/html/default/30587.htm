Listen, young adventurer! I will tell you the story of our people's origin. In the beginning there was Pa'agrio. And the ancestor of Orcs appeared from the blazing flame. His hair flared like fire; his eyes glared with fury, and anyone who dared to look into them had to turn away in painM his lungs erupted ashes; and blood in his veins was as hot as lava. No wonder there was nobody in the whole world whose strength and vitality could compare to his!<br>
Years were passing, and with time the Energy of Water chilled his body, the Energy of Earth cooled his blood, and Winds scattered the ashes of his lungs. Having lost his strength, the ancestor of Orcs was miserable. Seeing this, Pa'agrio revealed the greatest secret to him, fierce battles can make his blood boil again, and hard training can bring back his former strength. Since then, Orcs have been renowned for their might, and our weapon mastery has become a legend!
