<html><body>Magister Karen:<br>
My name is Karen. I'm a Wizard of the Ivory Tower. What brings you here?<br>
You want to know more about Hellbound, do you? The fallen wizard Beleth is hiding here striving to restore his magical power.<br>
For that reason he has made a deal with Vampires.<br>
Ivory Tower Wizards presume that Beleth is planing to conquer all the continent. That's why we are looking for experienced warriors who can stop him.<br>
All heroes who are ready to fight him and have reached <font color="LEVEL">Lv. 85 or higher</font> can go to Hellbound <font color="LEVEL">every Saturday from 10:00 till 24:00</font>.
