Nobody can help you but yourself.<br>
I came here from the Orc tribe to alert to a dreadful danger of Hellbound.<br>
Ivory Tower Wizards made Beleth run away to Hellbound, but even there, thousands of miles away from Aden, he is still plotting and gathering his strength.<br>
If you are strong enough to defeat him, go to Hellbound. I hope you can stop Beleth, so he won't be a threat to Aden anymore.<br>
I'm keeping watch over the path to Hellbound. Only brave warriors who have reached <font color="LEVEL">Lv. 85 or higher</font> are allowed to go there. The path is open <font color="LEVEL">every Saturday from 10:00 till midnight</font>.
