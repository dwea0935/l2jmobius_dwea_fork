To tell you the truth, I don't know the details. According to a legend, during the war with Humans who betrayed Elven race, we used forbidden magic. As a result, a vast territory was turned into a lifeless wasteland. Now this infected land is called the <font color="LEVEL">Sea of Spores</font>, and it still frows in size. One day the Sea of Spores might devour even our Elven Forest.<br>
And isn't it a bitter irony that Humans are the ones who prevent the Sea of Spores from expanding? I think that the Sea of Spores demostrates the grave foolishness of that Elven decision.
