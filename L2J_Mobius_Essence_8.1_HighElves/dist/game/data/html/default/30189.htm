Hi there!<br>
This area shares a border with Elmore, so of course it shares many similarities with that war-torn land. The whole place is like night and day compared to our Elven homeland.<br>
The houses here are rough and rambling, and the people are louts! They simply have no understanding of subtlety! Though, I should be grateful, they say it's even worse in Elmore. The Elves there must be so frustrated...<br>
I mean... Well, you know.
