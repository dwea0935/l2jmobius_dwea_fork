Ah, to meet a traveler in a place like this! I am Matheo, a scholar of folkish lore, dispatched from the <font color="LEVEL">Ivory Tower</font>. These days I am reseaching the history of the Talking Island.<br>

They were erected in ancient times by Elves of light that lived on the Talking Island. I think this was where Elves enchanters paid tribute to the island's <font color="LEVEL">Spirit King</font>.<br>
