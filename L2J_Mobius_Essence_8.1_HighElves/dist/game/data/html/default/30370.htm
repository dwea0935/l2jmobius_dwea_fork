<html><body>Nerupa:<br>
Welcome, traveler. I am Nerupa, the best warrior of the Arachnid. Long before you were born, I had made a contract with the Mother Tree, and I have already been protecting it for many centuries, helping the Elves.<br>
I presue you have come here for a reason. Tell me, what do you want?
