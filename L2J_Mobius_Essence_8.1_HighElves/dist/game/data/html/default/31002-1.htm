Hiccup~! Are you lost? I know how that feels!<br>
Hiccup~ Well, let's see... If you look to the west, you will see the Town of Oren...<br>
And that castle to north? That is Oren Castle... Hiccup~!<br>
Past the castle, cross the river and keep heading north... you will reach the Ivory Tower, home to the Mystics...<br>
