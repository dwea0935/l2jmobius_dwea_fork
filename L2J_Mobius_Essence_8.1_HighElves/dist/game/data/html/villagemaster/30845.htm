Nice to meet you! My name is Klump. I am the Warehouse Chief of Iron Gate Guild. At your service! The amount of goods going through Aden in no less than in Giran that is standing on the crossing of the trade routes. The sole difference is that we have more luxury items - decoration materials, works of art and the like. As for essentials, we have far fewer items of this kind.<br>
