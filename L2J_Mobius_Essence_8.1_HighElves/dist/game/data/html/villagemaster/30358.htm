<html><body>Great Hierarch Thifiell:<br>
May Shillien's power shade you from the harshness of light!<br>
On behalf of the Chief who was sealed by those despicable servants of light, I represent the senior council that governs the race of darkness. It was I, Great Hierarch Thifiell - chosen by Gran Kain, the father of shadow, and Shillien, the mother of the abyss - who led our brothers out of their underground exile and recaptured the Forest of Shadow from those moon-faced Elves of light! You, child of Shillien! What is it that you wish to know?<br>
