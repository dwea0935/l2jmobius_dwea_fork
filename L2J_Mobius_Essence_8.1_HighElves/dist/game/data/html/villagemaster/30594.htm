<html><body>Warehouse Chief Ranspo:<br>
I'm Warehouse Chief Ranspo of the Iron Gate Guild here in Dion. Our motto is "Sell anything to anyone, anywhere." We'll travel to frozen wastes, burning deserts, even fiery volcanic zones, in order to sell our wares and create prosperity for our Dwarven tribe. Ha! Who else can say half as much?<br>
But you're a new face, hmm? I don't think we've met before. What do you want?<br>
