Its' good that you have come to Goddard, the land of war and fire! Hot blood is up here, like lava flowing down the volcanos of northern high plane!<br>
Things don't change much here: filthy Varka Silenos and Ketra Orcs want to unleash a war, Fire Dragon Valakas has awakened from his sleep... Everything's just fine. Don't waste time while preparing yourself, because the time when children of Pa'agrio shall rise in arms is close!<br>
