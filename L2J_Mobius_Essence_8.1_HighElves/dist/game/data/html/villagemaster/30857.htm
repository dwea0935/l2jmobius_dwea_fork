Welcome to Aden, the heart of our kingdom! It is rightly called the cultural and religious center. The Temple of Light is a bastion of our faith, the beacon showing the way to all Einhasad's faithful.<br>
However, the flame of true faith is burning not only within the walls of this temple. There are many other places filled with Einhasad's grace. A prayer reaching to the heart of the Mother of Light can be heard even in the house of a common villager.<br>
