Which sign should I put up this month...? I need a slogan that will drive tons of customers! Hm... Hm, I think, I have an idea...<br>
"You have earned money with your blood and sweat, risking your life in a dragon's nest! Would you just give it to every Dick and Jane? Entrust it to your best companion - Iron Gate Guild Warehouse!"<br>
What do you say? You don't like it? Why? Too long... Ha! What would you know about marketing?!<br>
