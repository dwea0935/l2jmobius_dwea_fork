<html><body>Sentinel Starden:<br>
May the star song bring you happiness! I'm Starden, and I'm guarding this forest and the Mother Tree.<br>
I may look gloomy, and I'm terribly sorry for that. Previously I was an optimistic and fun-loving person, but unfortunately the war changed that. During <font color="LEVEL">the last fight for the Dungeon</font> I witnessed Dark Elves slaughtering my comrades... I've tried to forget that scene, but I still see nightmares.<br>
