<html><body>Sentinel Eriel:<br>
May the whisper of the wind bring peace to your soul. My name is Eriel. I refuse to recognize the place with the Dark Elves, so I volunteered to guard the Neutral Zone and make sure that they do not enter our forest.<br>
By the way, the Neutral Zone is located right behind this bridge. And if you go further south, you will find yourself in <font color="LEVEL">Gludio</font>. That Human settlement is the closest to the Elves.<br>
