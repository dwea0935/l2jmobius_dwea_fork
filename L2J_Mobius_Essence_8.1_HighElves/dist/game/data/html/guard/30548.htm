<html><body>Defender Nathan:<br>
Looking at these snow-covered peaks... I begin to think that our people is so small and insignificant. Just look at these mountains... Don't you think that in fact wealth and glory mean very little?<br>
Oh, I forgot to introduce myself. I'm Protector Nathan. I'm guarding our village despite this freezing cold.
