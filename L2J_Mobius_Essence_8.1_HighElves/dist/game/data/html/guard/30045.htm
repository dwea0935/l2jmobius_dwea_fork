Do you know that it was on Talking Island where Elves have shown Humans the art of magic for the first time? The <font color="LEVEL">Ruins</font> in the north of the island is the school, where Elves tought Humans many years ago.<br>
Elves do not live here anymore, but sometimes you can meet a very old hermit in this place.<br>
