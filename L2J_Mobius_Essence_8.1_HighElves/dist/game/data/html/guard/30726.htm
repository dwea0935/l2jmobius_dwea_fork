If you leave the town through this gate and go south, you will get to Oren. Oh, maybe you've just come from there? If you have, you already know everything. Maybe I should tell you about the Ivory Tower?<br>
I know its secret. I've heard it from a drunken wizard... And the following day he disappeared. So, do you want to know this dangerous secret?<br>
