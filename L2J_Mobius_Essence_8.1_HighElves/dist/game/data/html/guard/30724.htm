Welcome to the Ivory Tower!<br>
?<br>
Hm... Aren't you from the northern border by any chance? What's going on there? One lad at the outpost has told me that something wrong is going on there and nobody can leave their posts...<br>
The war against Elmore is over, and now something is up again! My younger sister and her husband are living there... Damn! I shouldn't have allowed her to marry!<br>
