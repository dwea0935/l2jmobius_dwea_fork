Lately I've been scouting the <font color="LEVEL">Death Pass</font>. There I've seen flying Harpies and Medusas. Awful creatures! Don't be deceived by their beautiful appearance! No mere mortal could escape their claws. Now I'm facing even worse monsters. I think I can manage them, but what about poor locals...?<br>
