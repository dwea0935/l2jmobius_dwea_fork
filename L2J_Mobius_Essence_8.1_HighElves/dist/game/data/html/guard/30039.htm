<html><body>Guard Captain Gilbert:<br>
Welcome. I'm Gilbert, a guard captain of Talking Island Village. Our duty is to protect villagers and the <font color="LEVEL">lighthouse</font> that day and night shines and calls vessels to the land.<br>
If you are going for a walk, ask guards about the island. I hope you don't want to get lost in the woods infested with Orcs.<br>
