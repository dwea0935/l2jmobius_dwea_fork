Talking Island seems to be a peaceful place but don't believe it! If you go outside the village, you will surely encounter wolves, giant spiders, Orcs, werewolves and other bloodthirsty creatures!<br>
Especially you should beware of murderous Orcs. Recently they have often been seen at the <font color="LEVEL">Obelisk of Victory</font>. Please be careful.<br>
