<html><body>Defender Cromwell:<br>
Nice to meet you! I'm Protector Cromwell, the guard of the Dwarven Village. You've heard about me? Yeah, my name's pretty rare, isn't it?<br>
Let me tell you one thing. There is a seashore to the north of this place. It's the best place if you want to take a rest. On my free days I usually go there to get some fresh air. Of course, it's better to spend time there with a loved one, but it's good even if you're alone.
