<html><body>Guard Rhiannon:<br>
Welcome to the Talking Island Village! My name is Rhiannon, I'm a Guard here. My task is to protect the village from Orcs and Werewolves. And also to keep an eye on the locals, so they respect the law.<br>
I want to warn you. If you do any harm to other people, a severe punishment is waiting for you. Every criminal should get what they deserve. It is cruel, but right.
