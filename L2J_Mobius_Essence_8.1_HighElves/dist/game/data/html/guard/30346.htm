Hello there! Have you traveled a lot? I've always dreamed of seeing the world. I'll definitely go to Elmore after retiring. There lives one of the strongest Dark Elven clans - the <font color="LEVEL">Pavel's</font> family.<br>
Unfortunately, <font color="LEVEL">the School of Dark Arts</font> is really unsafe now, and I can only dream of going on vacation.<br>
