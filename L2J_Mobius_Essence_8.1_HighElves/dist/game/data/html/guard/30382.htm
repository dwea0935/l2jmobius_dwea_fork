To the northeast from here lie the <font color="LEVEL">Ruins of Agony</font>. Previously there was my home village, but it was burned to the ground during the war... When you see that place, you'll know for sure why it is called the Ruins of Agony.<br>
Go north from there, and you will see the <font color="LEVEL">Dark Forest</font>. I've never been there myself... But according to travelers, it's a gloomy and dreadful place.<br>
