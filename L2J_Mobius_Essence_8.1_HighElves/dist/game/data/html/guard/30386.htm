They say that <font color="LEVEL">Demon Beleth</font> slumbers somewhere in these endless fields. The legend says that the reason why southern part of Gludio became a desert and the insects that lived there turned into monsters lies in the sinister energy emanating from Beleth, who is sealed deep underground.<br>
The <font color="LEVEL">Giant Ants</font> from the Wasteland often make their way in here and make Guards busy.<br>
