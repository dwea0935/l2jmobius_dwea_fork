<html><body>Guard Moretti:<br>
Welcome! Standing guard all day may seem very boring to you, but I really like talking with travelers. And the east gates are near the <font color="LEVEL">Elven Forest</font>, and you can often see the Elves here. Now I'm used to it, but the first time I saw them, I was very surprised...
