<html><body>Guard Johnstone:<br>
I dreamed of getting to <font color="LEVEL">Einhovant's School of Magic</font> and becoming a mage, since I was a child. But unfortunately the teachers said that I dind't have any gift for it.<br>
It seems I was meant to be a warrior. I ended up being a guard and I don't regret anything.<br>
