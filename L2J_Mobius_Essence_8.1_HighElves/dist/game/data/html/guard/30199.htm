Stop! You are now in the Oren Territory. My duty is to warn travelers about local dangers. There are monsters everywhere. Except maybe to the west from here... There lies the Elven Forest. Check the map if you don't believe me.<br>
They say that forest is really beautiful. Hope I will see it one day with my own eyes... Unfortunately, it is separated from us by the Dragonclaw mountains.
