<html><body>Guard Chiperan:<br>
I used to be a mercenary fighting for money. I sailed up on Talking Island on a merchant ship I had been hired to guard. I was amazed by magnificence of the land so much that I decided to stay here.<br>
What a beautiful sea sunrises, green forests and a <font color="LEVEL">waterfall</font>... There is no such beauty in Aden.<br>
