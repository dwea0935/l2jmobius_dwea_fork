<html><body>Sentinel Berros:<br>
I wish you a pleasant stay at our lake. My name is Berros, and I'm guarding this forest and the Mother Tree.<br>
When I was young, I traveled a lot and visited almost every corner of the world. And I can tell you for sure: each place has something to look at, but our Elven Village is the most beautiful of them all.<br>
