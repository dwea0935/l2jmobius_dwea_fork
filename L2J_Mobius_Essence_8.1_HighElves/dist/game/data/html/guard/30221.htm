<html><body>Sentinel Rayen:<br>
May this forest's breeze bring you cool! I'm Rayen. I was ordered to kill all strangers who disrupt the peace of this forest.<br>
The Elven Forest is our people's birthplace. However, I think that we hid for too long here, and it made us vulnerable. That is why I always advise young Elves to travel to the outside world and get more practical experience. For example, you can go to <font color="LEVEL">Gludio</font> to the south from here.<br>
