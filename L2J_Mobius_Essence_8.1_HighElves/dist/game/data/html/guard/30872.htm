Have you ever been to the Narsell Lake to the south of the city? There used to be a lot of boats by the pier and people would fish off the shore... Good times. We can't even approach the lake now because of the war... But recently someone saw His Majesty King Amadeo riding on a boat with Lady Castella... Maybe soon the'll let common people come to the lake, too? That would be nice...
