Hello, I'm guard Curtis. I help Sir Ortho Lancer maintain order in the city. In his youth, Sir Lancer gained fame in the ranks of the Black Lions. He is always full of energy and seems to never get tired.<br>
Recently Sir Lancer is very concerned about monsters from the <font color="LEVEL">Execution Grounds</font> near Dion.<br>
