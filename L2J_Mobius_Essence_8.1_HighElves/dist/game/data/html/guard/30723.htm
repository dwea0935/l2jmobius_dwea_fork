Welcome to the <font color="LEVEL">Ivory Tower</font>, traveler! My name is Roy, I'm a Guard Captain here. A long while ago I had come to the Ivory Tower to become a wizard but soon realized that it's not my path. So, I started to stand guard over the tower. If you want to learn more about this place, just ask me.<br>
