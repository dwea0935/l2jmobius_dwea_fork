To the north of Aden Castle lies the Blazing Swamp. As you might guess, the land there is covered in fire and hot lava. Legend has it that this place was created by Pa'agrio himself... Even the monsters that live there have special properties. They all use some fire magic. By the order of King Raoul, water canals were dug around the swamp to prevent fire from spreading. However, the Blazing Swamp became really famous after the battle of king Amadeo with Elmore's troops... Oops, I am talking too much, sorry!<br>
