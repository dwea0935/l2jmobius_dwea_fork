Hey, are you heading for the <font color="LEVEL">Mandragora Farm</font>? I wouldn't go there if I were you, though. It's very dangerous there!<br>
Someone named <font color="LEVEL">Aron Nightshade</font> is in charge of everything there - quite a sinister person. Personally, I won't set a food there!<br>
