Greetings! Welcome to the Aden Castle!<br>
If you leave the city and head east, you will come to the Cemetery where all royal family members and saints have been buried since the Elmoreden times. There lie all kings, stating from His Majesty Raoul the Unifier and ending with the latest deceased ruler.<br>
True, recently the Cemetery has fallen into decay... Damn these monsters!<br>
