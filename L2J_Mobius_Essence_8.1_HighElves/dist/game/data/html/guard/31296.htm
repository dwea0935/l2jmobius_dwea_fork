<html><body>Guard Cadmon:<br>
Be careful if you are going to leave town! A lot of dangerous monster roam the land right now. And also those constant fights between <font color="LEVEL">Varka Silenos on the west</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Ketra Orcs in the north</font>... I hope they would kill each other and make our lives easier...<br>
Just remember that a wrong move may cost you your life outside the town!<br>
