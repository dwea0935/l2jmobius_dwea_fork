Welcome, young traveler! You know, Gludio was the first town built in these lands after the settlers drove the Orcs and Lizardmen away. It survived the rule of Beleth and the great war with Gracia. And though enemies constantly strived to burn the town to the ground, the defenders of Gludio repelled all their attacks. And mark my words, this time will be no different. The Turek Orcs can boast as much as they like, but they will end up the same way as all the previous invaders.<br>
