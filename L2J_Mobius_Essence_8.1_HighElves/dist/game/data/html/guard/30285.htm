<html><body>Sentinel Gartrandell:<br>
May the stars guide your way! My name is Gartrandell, and I'm guarding this forest and the Mother Tree. During the war with the Dark Elves I was heavily wounded, so they sent me to reserves and ordered to guard <font color="LEVEL">Eva's Shrines</font>.<br>
This is the heritage of the great Elven culture, so I'm proud of the trust placed in me. Also, the work here lets me see my beloved more often.<br>
