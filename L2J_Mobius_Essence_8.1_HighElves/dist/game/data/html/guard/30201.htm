<html><body>Guard Pinaps:<br>
It's good to see you, adventurer! What brings you to Oren? It's pretty dangerous around here. Do you know that? North-westward there is the Sea of Spores, to the North stands the the Ivory Tower, north-eastward - the Tower of Insolence, and to the east you find the <font color="LEVEL">Enchanted Valley</font>.<br>
All these places are dangerous. You can ask other guards about it. I can tell you only about the <font color="LEVEL">Enchanted Valley</font>. Do you want to hear about it?<br>
