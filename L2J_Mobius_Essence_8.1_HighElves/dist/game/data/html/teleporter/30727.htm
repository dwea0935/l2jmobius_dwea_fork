Hello, seeker of knowledge. Welcome to the Ivory Tower! I'm the Gatekeeper Verona.<br>
The Ivory Tower has several floors. To teleport to another one, you need to talk to us, Gatekeepers.<br>
Now you're on the first floor, in the lobby. Here you can find the merchant's row. The guild of Human Wizards is on the 2nd floor, The Elven Mystic Guild is on the 3rd, and the Dark Mystic Guild is on the 4th. Where would you like to go?<br>
