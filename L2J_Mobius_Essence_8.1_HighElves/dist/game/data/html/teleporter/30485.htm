<html><body>Ivory Tower Wizard Belkadhi:<br>
They used to send the sorceresses of the Ivory Tower here, but unlike their appearance, their temper isn't perfect, which caused damaging some artifacts during the battle. That0s why our strong but delicate wizards have been sent here to conduct this research that doesn't require high qualification. Ha, ha, ha!<br>
Anyway, it's dangerous to go further. If you're not ready, you'd better return after more training.<br>
