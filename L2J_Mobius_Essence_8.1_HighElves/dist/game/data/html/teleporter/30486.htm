The 1st floor of the dungeon is crawling with monsters. There is a giant door in the center that cannot be opened by any usual means. I think there is some secret way to open it, but I don't know what it is. I haven't been stationed here long, you see.<br>
If you nevertheless decide to go upstairs, I won't stand in your way. So what will it be? Will you go upstairs?<br>
