Oh, hello! I've been sent here to find out what's going on in these <font color="LEVEL">Fairy-invaded Lands</font>.<br>
Once this place was called the Windmill Hill. But the windmills are not in use anymore, though in times past they found innumerable sacks of gain. Winds from the sea span them nonstop.<br>
However, later the windmills are fields around them fell in disrepair, and nobody lived there for a long time, Until the Fairies came... They were not seen on the continent for such a long time, so why appear now? What do they want? That's what I must find out.<br>
According to my data, <font color="LEVEL">the northern part of the invaded lands is far more dangerous than the southern one</font>. Also, some <font color="LEVEL">very strong Fairies</font> appear in each of the parts <font color="LEVEL">for a certain time period</font>. I believe they are the ones commanding the invaders. So best be careful if you decide to go there.<br>
