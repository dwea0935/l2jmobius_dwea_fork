The tension between Xilenos and Morgos has been slowly building up without escalating into an open war. This place has always been so peaceful. Xilenos have been gathering here only during their religious celebrations.<br>
But something has changed lately. Xilenos warriors have been patrolling this area more often recently.<br>
Nothing has really changed inside the Xilenos Fortress. Only <font color="LEVEL">Xilenos Patrols</font> appear every time <font color="LEVEL">Morgos' Comando Captain Jakal</font> comes here. It seems this old conflic starts to escalate.<br>
