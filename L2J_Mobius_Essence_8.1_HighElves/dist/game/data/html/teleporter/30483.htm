<html><body>Ivory Tower Wizard Carsus:<br>
My name is Carsus, I'm a member of the Ivory Tower Investigator Guild. We've completed the investigation of the Tower's higher part and are now occupied with the lower floors.<br>
We've set up an <font color="LEVEL">elevator</font> to begin our research with the <font color="LEVEL">3rd floor of the dungeon</font> which is considered to be the least dangerous. If you need any help moving around, I will gladly help you. All you need to do is tell me which floor you would like to go to.<br>
However, I can't teleport you to the 1st floor of the dungeon because the raid boss controlling all creatures of Cruma Tower lives there. To go to the 1st floor, talk to <font color="LEVEL">Ivory Tower Wizard Ian</font> on the <font color="LEVEL">2nd floor</font>.<br>
