<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Cliff:<br>
Welcome, welcome! Do you have something heavy? Too many belongings? Then leave them here.<br>
Trust me, it's one of the safest warehouses in the world, as it belongs to the Dwarven Bank association. Just say the word, and I'll bring you what you're asking for. Or take it from you, if that's your wish. You'll definitely like our service! You don't need to worry about your possessions. The history knows a lot of wars: from the ancient one between the Gods and the Giants to the recent war with Elmore. But have you ever heard about a theft in a Dwarven warehouse? I believe you haven't!<br>
