<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Ballin:<br>
Welcome! I think it's obvious that I don't hurt for money. I have a lot of customers now - everyone wants to leave their possessions at our warehouse. At this rate, I'll soon become the head of the Iron Gate Guild's office! But don't tell anyone about my ambitions!<br>
By the way, if you leave your things here, you can then withdraw them anywhere. However, we must know for sure who will come for them.<br>
