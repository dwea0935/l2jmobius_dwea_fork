<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Marty:<br>
If you're tired of carrying everything with you for fear of losing or leaving something behind, just use our warehouse. We, Dwarves, manage the vast majority of all warehouses and banks on the continent. Also, if you leave your belonging with us, you can withdraw them anywere you want!<br>
If you're still in doubt, let me tell you this: We have an office even in the Ivory Tower. The royal family themselves don't have anything like it!<br>
