Come closer. Are you here to drop your belongings or for something else? I'm very tired, so let's get down to business. By the way, I work only on a prepaid basis. It's really stupid to carry all your belongings around. Much better if you put your unnecessaries into the stockroom. They will be in safe keping there.<br>
