<html><body>Warehouse Warehouse Keeper Carlon:<br>
What is the situation in Dark Elf Village? I'm worried about them. Those Dark Elves have been battling Shillien's evil creatures... and now, we can't even get near the village to check on them. It's too dangerous. Yes, during times like this, ample food storage becomes very important. You never know when our town might be surrounded by evil, slobbering, red-eyed creatures from the deep dark swamps... errr... Sorry. If you're out of room in your packs, you can leave your items with me. My warehouse is well-secured against invaders, fire, magic attacks and mold.<br>
