<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Pochi:<br>
Welcome! Do you want to store your belongings? Or maybe withdraw something? By the way, have you visited the neighboring shop? The one that sells luxuries. If you haven't, be sure to stop by. Its owner, mister Galladucci, is also a Dwarf. His manner of speech is somewhat strange, but his heart is of pure gold. Do visit him sometime. He has a lot of wonderful goods.<br>
