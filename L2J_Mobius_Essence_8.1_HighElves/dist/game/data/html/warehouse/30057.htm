Heading out on an adventure, eh? Are you really planning on taking all that stuff? Let me give you some advice, kid. Don't weigh yourself down with all sorts of unnecessary equipment. Just take what you need, and leave the rest with me. The Iron Gate Guild will keep your items safe and secure until you come back.<br>
Better yet, any items you deposit with us, you can withdraw at any city!<br>
