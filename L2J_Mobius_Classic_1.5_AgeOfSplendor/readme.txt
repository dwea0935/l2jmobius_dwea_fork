## Clans
- Clan level maximum is 5, requiring Adena, SP and special items to raise, with no quest requirements.

- Clan Wars can be declared on up to 30 other clans at the same time, with no limit on received declarations.
- Clan War: A clan war can be started by a clan leader using the /clanwarstart command and it ends when the declaration is withdrawn. Clan members lose 4% of experience if they die during the 3-day grace period, but only 25% of the standard death penalty during the war.
- Clan Reputation: Clans can acquire reputation points when members level up or kill enemies during an active clan war. Reputation points are used to learn special clan skills.
