# This is the server configuration file. Here you can set up the connection information for your server.

# LAN (LOCAL area network) - typically consists of computers connected to the same router as you.
# WAN (WIDE area network) - typically consists of computers OUTSIDE of your router (ie. the internet).
# x.x.x.x - Format of an IP address. Do not include the x'es into settings. Must be real numbers.
