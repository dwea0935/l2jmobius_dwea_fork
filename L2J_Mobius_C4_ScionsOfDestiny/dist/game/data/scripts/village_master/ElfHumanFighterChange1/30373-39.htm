Congratulations! You have now become a magnificent Elf Scout. Life as an Elf Scout may still be unfamiliar, but do not be anxious. You can learn it one step at a time from the masters nearby.<br>
I pray that you will become a cunning Elf Scout whose deeds always reflect the light of Eva's name. Never forget your dignity and integrity as an Elf, and always remain steadfast in your vows. Congratulations once again!<br>
