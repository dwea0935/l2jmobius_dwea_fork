Congratulations! You have now become a magnificent Elf Knight. Life as an Elf Knight may still be unfamiliar, but do not be anxious. You can learn it one step at a time from the masters nearby.<br>
I pray that you will become a renowned Elf Knight whose deeds always reflect the light of Eva's name. Never forget your dignity and integrity as an Elf, and always remain steadfast in your vows. Congratulations once again!<br>
