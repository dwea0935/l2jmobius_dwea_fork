Congratulations! You have now become a magnificent Rogue. Life as a Rogue may still be unfamiliar, but do not be anxious. You can learn it one step at a time from the masters nearby.<br>
I pray that you will become a cunning Rogue whose fame spreads throughout the continent of Aden. Never forget your convictions, whatever the cost. Congratulations once again!<br>
