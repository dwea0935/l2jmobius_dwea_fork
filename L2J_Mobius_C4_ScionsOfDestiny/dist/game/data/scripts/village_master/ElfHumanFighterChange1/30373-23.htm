Congratulations! You have finally become a strong warrior. Life as a warrior may still be unfamiliar, but do not be anxious. You can learn it one step at a time from the masters nearby.<br>
I pray that you will continue to grow in strength as a devoted and unyielding warrior. Congratulations once again!<br>
