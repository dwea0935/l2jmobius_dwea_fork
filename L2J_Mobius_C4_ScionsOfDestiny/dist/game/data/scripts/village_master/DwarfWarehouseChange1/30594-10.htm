Congratulations! You've finally become a proud member of the Iron Gate Guild. You can learn the skills you'll need from the Warehouse Keepers over there. Devote yourself to your work; remember the old saying that "the most useless thing under the sun is a penniless Dwarf" and don't let that happen to you!<br>
