Congratulations! You have become a magnificent Temple Knight. Life as a Temple Knight may seem unfamiliar to you at first, but you can learn more skills from the masters nearby.<br>
I pray that you will become a great Temple Knight whose actions reflect glory on the name of Eva, the goddess of water. Never forget your dignity and integrity as an Elf, and always remain steadfast in your vows. Congratulations once again!<br>
